## No more wasted music talents at Brandeis

Every student who plays an instrument knows how daunting it is to find students to collaborate on a music project, rehearse and practice for an event, or simply jam and have a good time. However, this does not have to be the case. Almost everyone has a smartphone, and, with the world at the peak of communication technology, there is no reason for campus musicians to stay disconnected. JamSeshNow is the missing piece. We offer an efficient connection medium for students who want to meet and play music with each other. Itâ€™s as easy as setting up a profile, searching through filters, and then looking through the profiles of other musicians with their own sample music playing in the background. Once any number of musicians choose each other, they can decide where to meet from a variety of spaces and studios on campus or locally.
