## No more wasted music talents at Brandeis

Every student who plays an instrument knows how daunting it is to find students to collaborate on a music project, rehearse and practice for an event, or simply jam and have a good time. However, this does not have to be the case. Almost everyone has a smartphone, and, with the world at the peak of communication technology, there is no reason for campus musicians to stay disconnected. JamSeshNow is the missing piece. We offer an efficient connection medium for students who want to meet and play music with each other. It’s as easy as setting up a profile, searching through filters, and then looking through the profiles of other musicians with their own sample music playing in the background. Once any number of musicians choose each other, they can decide where to meet from a variety of spaces and studios on campus or locally. 

## Head and shoulder above competition

What can we provide that our competitors couldn’t provide in their web-apps? How do we appeal to student musicians at Brandeis? There was only one good way to find this out: ask them! With the help of Avi’s large network of Brandeis musicians, we were able to create a channel to conduct in-depth one-on-one interviews with our customer segment. We received very encouraging feedback (we discuss this more in our MVP section), and we learned that accessibility is crucial for our service. We pulled together a combination that is sure to guzzle the atmosphere in an all-in-one, easy to use Android and iOS application. A product with helpful, customized filters, like location and musical instrument, a matching algorithm that emulates best-in-class apps like Tinder, and a creative one of a kind Instant Music Play feature that makes searching through users a breeze.
