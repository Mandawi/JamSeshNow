description: We are JamSeshNow, and we connect student musicians together to collaborate with one another in any way they see fit. We believe in completely changing the dull music scene at Brandeis. With a monthly subscription, students will be able to access our expansive database of musicians at Brandeis University, and local spaces and studios available for use; Additionally, they will be able to make use of customized filters and features, like adding multiple music samples to their profile, which enables them to find and be found by their best-fit music partners.
